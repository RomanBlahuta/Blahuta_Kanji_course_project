# Blahuta_Kanji_course_project
Programming fundamentals course project

This web-app is designed to help with studying japanese. The info is gathered from Jisho.org and KanjiAlive.com websites. The program sends various GET requests to online databases or uses its own files in case of Hiragana and Katakana learning.
This application offers a big variety of information about three japanese scripts: Kanji, Hiragana, Katakana. Not only can the user search the hieroglyphs but also learn them through playing minigames designed for this very reason.
The user can switch between various gamemodes and the very important principal of learning kanji is not to just memorise the pattern but to understand it, learning and memorising radicals in other words.
